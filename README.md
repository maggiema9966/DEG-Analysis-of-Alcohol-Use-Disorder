# Associations of Alcohol Use Disorder With Smoking & Depression and Classifying AUD
This project focuses on the correlations between Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) and its comorbidities (depression and smoking), as well as using the researchers’ differentially expressed gene (DEG) findings (see references) to create a practical use of their work using a K-Nearest Neighbors model that will help with diagnosing AUD. The aims of this project include analyzing DEGs for smoking status and depression (under control AUD), then determining whether they overlap with the DEGs found for AUD. An additional aim was building a K-Nearest Neighbors model for both the prefrontal cortex and the nucleus accumbens regions of the brain in order to assist in the diagnosis of patients with AUD.

## Background
The goal of this project is to clarify the “gray area” surrounding the correlation between depression, smoking habits, and AUD. Moreover, a key problem with the Alcohol Symptoms Checklist is that the questions can seem subjective, and there is a high chance of response bias, whether because patients are ashamed, unwilling to tell the truth, or unsure of their answers. This project attempts to provide a more objective way to assist in diagnosing AUD through a classifier based on gene expressions.
This project aims to supplement the original research on Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) by analyzing the comorbidities that the researchers identified to determine similarities and differences between differential expressions of the AUDs with the covariates and the covariates (smoking and depression) by themselves. Then, we will further develop this research into a more practical use of the findings by building a K-Nearest Neighbors model to use biomarkers to identify possible AUD patients.

## Aim 1: Compare DEGs
One main goal of this project was to compare the DEGs of smoking status and depression with the control, AUD. Then, we determined whether they overlap with the DEGs found for AUD. This could tell us which DEGs found in the AUD analyses done by the original researchers were really due to smoking status and depression instead.
#### Sub-Aim: Biological Pathways
A sub-aim we had was to look for potential biological pathways associated with the DEGs we found in both overlapping and non-overlapping genes.

## Aim 2: K-Nearest Neighbor Classifier
A second goal of this project was to build a K-Nearest Neighbors model for both the prefrontal cortex and the nucleus accumbens regions of the brain in order to assist in the diagnosis of patients with AUD. This includes finding the most accurate k number of neighbors to work with.
